Why use HED?
------------

HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors) is an infrastructure and
a controlled vocabulary that allows researchers to annotate
their experimental data, especially events,
so that tools can use this information.

For more information on Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED),
visit the [HED documentation page](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Documentation.html)
for a complete list of resources.
